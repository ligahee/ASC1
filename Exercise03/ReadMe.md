## Practice loops and operators
1. `FizzBuzz.cs` 
   a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns
   to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word /fizz/, any
   number divisible by five with the word /buzz/, and any number divisible by both with /
   fizzbuzz/.
2. `PrecedingCode.cs`
   What will happen if this code executes?
   `int max = 500;
   for (byte i = 0; i < max; i++)
   {
   WriteLine(i);
   }`
   Create a console application and enter the preceding code. Run the console application
   and view the output. What happens?
   What code could you add (donâ€™t change any of the preceding code) to warn us about the
   problem?

   The code will produce an infinite loop, as the byte data type has a maximum value of 255, To warn about this problem, I add a conditional statement within the loop that checks whether i has reached its maximum value and breaks out of the loop.
3. `RandomNum.cs`
   Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 3 and asks the user to
   guess what the number is. Tell the user if they guess low, high, or get the correct answer.
   Also, tell the user if their answer is outside of the range of numbers that are valid guesses
   (less than 1 or more than 3).
